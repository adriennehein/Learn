          <p id="short">He has lived in San Diego his whole life until he went to college in Arizona
            for a year. He then realized that Arizona sucks and came back to San Diego,
            where he has been ever since. <br> When he was in
            Kindergarten, he broke his left wrist riding his new bike. Unfortunately for
            Jack, he was learning how to write at the time. Since he is left handed, he was
            forced to learn to write with his right hand. As a result, Jack now performs
            certain tasks with his right hand, and others with his left. It's super weird.

          <p>She is from Portland, OR originally and then moved to Boston for a temporary escape. Since being cold
            is one of her least favorite things, it was time to relocate to San Diego until she gets sick of
            sun. Her next home will either be Vancouver, Seattle, Barcelona or Guadalajara.<br> She also has a story about a broken wrist: When visiting family in Germany, her cousins
            insisted on taking her to an Oktoberfest.  Much Oktoberfesting was done, and on the way home at 5am,
            one cousin decided to jump on the other cousin's back, and a wrist was subsequently broken.  Somehow,
            Adrienne was blamed for the incident, and was suddenly no longer welcome in the home. It was kinda awkward.</p>
